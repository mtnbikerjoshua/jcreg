\description{
Measuring body fat is not simple. One method requires submerging the body
underwater in a tank and measuring the increase in water level. A simpler
method for estimating body fat would be preferred. In order to develop such a
method, researchers recorded age (years), weight (pounds), height (inches),
and three body circumference measurements (around the neck, chest, and
abdominal (all in centimeters)) for 252 men. Each manâ€™s percentage of body
fat was accurately estimated by an underwater weighing technique (the
variable brozek is the percentage of body fat). The hope of this data is to
create a model that will accurately predict body fat percentage, by using
just the basic variables recorded, without having to use the tank submerging
method.
